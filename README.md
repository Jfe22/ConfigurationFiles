# Configuration Files
My configuration files for zsh, tmux, nvim.



## Usage
1 - `git clone` this repo.

2 - If you are not using zsh/tmux/nvim, comment the corresponding line in `inject.zsh`.

3 - Execute `inject.zsh`, and the configurations will be added to your terminal.



## Warning
These configuration files were made for zshell.

However, if you are running bash and execute `inject.zsh` as it is, you will still get tmux and nvim configurations.

As an added bonus, you will have a `.zshrc` waiting for you in your home directory if you ever switch shells.
