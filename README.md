# Configuration Files
My configuration files for nvim, tmux, zsh, etc.


## Usage
Execute `inject.zsh`, and every configuration will be added to your terminal.
If you are not using some of the utilities handled by this file, you can simply comment them out in the `inject.zsh` file.


## Warning
These configuration files were made for zshell.
However, if you are running bash and execute `inject.zsh` as it is, you will still get tmux and nvim configurations.
As an added bonus, you will have a `.zshrc` waiting for you in your home directory if you ever switch shells.
